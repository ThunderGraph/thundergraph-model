## Why this exists

Most “architecture” tools stop at diagrams. **ThunderGraph Model** is a **small, strict Python library** for modeling **systems** the way engineers think: **parts**, **interfaces**, **constraints**, **requirements with acceptance**, **nested requirement structures**, **discrete behavior**, and **provenance** — all tied together so you can **compile**, **evaluate**, and **validate** a configuration, not just draw it.

It is built for **MBSE**-style workflows, **digital twin** sketches, and **executable specs** where **units matter** (`unitflow`), **requirements are the locus of acceptance**, and **citations** attach to real design elements for traceability. **External compute** can hydrate discipline outputs (`attribute(..., computed_by=...)`) while the graph keeps dependencies explicit.

If you want a library that feels **honest** (fail-fast validation, explicit graphs) and **hackable** (plain Python, no proprietary runtime), you’re in the right place.

---

## What you get

| Capability | What it means for engineering |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Structured authoring** | `System` / `Part` / `RequirementBlock` with `define(cls, model)` — declare ports, parameters, attributes, constraints, behavior, and **nested requirement blocks** in one place. |
| **Unit-aware expressions** | Parameters and attributes use **unitflow**; constraints and requirement acceptance evaluate on real quantities. |
| **Requirements + allocation** | Requirements can live in **nested** `RequirementBlock` trees (dot-path refs). `allocate` links them to **parts** or the configured root; optional **`requirement_input` / `requirement_accept_expr`** plus **`allocate(..., inputs={...})`** bind part values into acceptance without globals. |
| **Cross-hierarchy parameters** | **`parameter_ref(RootType, "param_name")`** lets nested `define()` bodies read scenario or program parameters in a compile-safe way. |
| **External computation** | **`ExternalComputeBinding`**, **`attribute(computed_by=...)`**, and graph compilation wire fake or real tools into the same `Evaluator` pipeline as expressions and constraints. |
| **Citations & references** | `citation` nodes and `references` edges bind standards, reports, or clauses to declared elements — provenance without pretending to be a bibliography manager. |
| **Discrete behavior** | States, events, guards, sequences, fork/join, item flow across ports — **scenarios** for trace validation. |
| **Execution** | `instantiate` → `compile_graph` → `Evaluator` on a `RunContext` — one pipeline for constraints, requirement checks, and external compute. |

## Quick start

This directory is its **own [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) project** (separate from the monorepo root venv).

```bash
cd thundergraph-model
uv sync --all-groups       # dev group: pytest, ruff, mypy, nbconvert/ipykernel, …
uv run pytest              # includes coverage on tg_model (see pyproject.toml)
uv run pytest --no-cov     # faster when you do not need a coverage report
uv run ruff check tg_model tests
uv run mypy tg_model
```

---

## Examples in this repo

The **installable wheel** only contains **`tg_model`**. Larger **walkthroughs** live beside it:

| Location | What it is |
|----------|------------|
| [`examples/commercial_aircraft/`](examples/commercial_aircraft/) | Requirements-first cargo-jet slice: stdlib L1 specs, nested `RequirementBlock`, `allocate(inputs=…)`, roll-ups, two external-compute owners, reporting extract/snapshot. Put **`thundergraph-model/examples`** on `PYTHONPATH` and `import commercial_aircraft`. See that folder’s [`README.md`](examples/commercial_aircraft/README.md). |
| [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) | Jupyter demos (AEV, LEO stack, sodium fast reactor, cargo jet). |

**Notebook demos** (run from `thundergraph-model/` after `uv sync`; dev group includes `ipykernel` / `nbconvert`):

```bash
uv run jupyter lab notebooks/autonomous_electric_vehicle.ipynb
uv run jupyter lab notebooks/leo_launch_vehicle_deep_stack.ipynb
uv run jupyter lab notebooks/sodium_fast_reactor_demo.ipynb
uv run jupyter lab notebooks/cargo_jet_program.ipynb
```

Headless check:

```bash
uv run jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/cargo_jet_program.ipynb --stdout > /dev/null
```

## Documentation

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| [`docs/v0_api.md`](docs/v0_api.md) | Public API shape, authoring patterns, nested requirements, execution contract. |
| [`docs/implementation_plan.md`](docs/implementation_plan.md) | Phased roadmap (requirements, behavior, citations, …). |
| [`docs/logical_architecture.md`](docs/logical_architecture.md) | Conceptual architecture. |
| [`examples/commercial_aircraft/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](examples/commercial_aircraft/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) | Bounded-context plan for the cargo example (optional deep dive). |

---

## Development

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| **pytest** + **pytest-cov** | **225** tests under [`tests/`](tests/): **`tests/unit/`** (model, execution, analysis, …) and **`tests/integration/`** (e2e evaluation, external compute, requirement acceptance, behavior, **commercial aircraft smoke**, structural demos). Default `addopts` run **`--cov=tg_model`**. |
| **Ruff** | Lint + import sort (`E`, `F`, `I`, `UP`, `RUF`). |
| **mypy** | **Strict** typing on `tg_model`. |

Typical loop:

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check tg_model tests && uv run ruff format tg_model tests
uv run mypy tg_model
```

**Coverage** badge (~**87%** for `tg_model` with the current suite) comes from `uv run pytest`; re-run to refresh.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. Keep changes focused, match existing style (`ruff` / `mypy`), and extend **tests** when you touch behavior or contracts — prefer **unit** tests for isolated rules and **integration** tests for compile → instantiate → evaluate paths.

If you want to **talk engineering** about MBSE, nuclear, automotive, or digital twins — this library is meant to be **used**, not just read.
